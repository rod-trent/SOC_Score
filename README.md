Building the SOC Score for Azure Sentinel

Inventing the "SOC Score" for Azure Sentinel.

Much like a "credit" score, security teams can perform activities to improve the number.

How can my team improve our SOC Score?

Here's some recommended activities:

* Close cases/incidents (Medium/High severity)
* Review Informational-level Incidents and close them.
* Where applicable, adjust Analytics Rules to stop producing Incidents for Informational-level Incidents.
* Tune originating, connected services to help eliminate noise.
* Address Low-severity Incidents and determine to raise severity or close them.
* Assign Incidents to analysts

If it's difficult to maintain a good score, it's an indication that it might be time to:

* Assign security duties full time (instead of shared responsibility)
* Hire new security team members
* Review and evolve procedures
* Addressing the Incidents with higher SOC Severity will improve the SOC Severity Score.

Closing out more current cases and at least assigning ownership will improve the SOC Incident Score.

Paying heed to both of these will improve the overall SOC Score.
